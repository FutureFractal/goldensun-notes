# 1 Not just shifting but inplace replacing dism

In private communications, the marker is "You know how you can enter replace rather than edit mode? And your text never shifts anyway?"

The idea is until we have shifting disassembly, we could preserve the sizes of all key symbols like functions. We just have to inplace write. 

This could gracefully add a return on overflow, error on overflow, or just cut off excess. 

This alone would make it possible to modify functions to some extent for reverse engineering purposes. All manners of programmable/conditional early returns become possible to test behavior.

# 2 To create a building disasm shifting to decomp with struct indices

So we need something to build, primarily. And disasm > blob.  We also would like to be able to easily do matching decomp on key functions.
